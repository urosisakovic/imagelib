# imagelib
<p>
Python module containing digital image processing and computer vision algorithms.
</p>

<p>
In progress. Written for practice.
</p>

### Implemented algorithms:
* Affine transformation
    * Rotation
    * Resizement
    * General Affine transformation
* Canny edge detection
* Hough transform
* Blurring
* Utility functions

### To do:
* Rewrite time consuming functions using C++ and Eigen to make them time efficient
* Circle Hough transform
* Sharpening of an image
* Camera calibration
* Ray tracing
* etc.
